# Project Progress Log

This document tracks the milestones and progress for the LLM Auto-Bencher project.

---

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Planning (✅ Completed)
*   **[✅] Project Directory & Git:** Initialized repository and project structure.
*   **[✅] Planning Documents:** Created initial versions of all planning documents.
*   **[✅] Python Environment:** Set up `venv` and `requirements.txt`.
*   **[✅] Server Architecture:** Documented the Proxmox test environment in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

---

### Phase 2: Milestone 1 - Hardware Detection (✅ Completed)
*   **[✅] Python Implementation:** Developed a robust script (`main.py`) to detect CPU, RAM, Disk (device, total, used, free), and NVIDIA GPU specs.
*   **[✅] Shell Equivalent:** Created a parallel shell script (`shell_equivalents/detect_hardware.sh`) for comparison.
*   **[✅] Live Validation:** Successfully ran `main.py` on the `llm-server` VM, correctly detecting the passed-through RTX 2060 GPU and LVM disk partitions.

### Phase 3: Milestone 2 - Dynamic Recommendation Engine (⏳ In Progress)
*   **[⏳] [2A] API Discovery:** Need to identify and test the `https://ollama.com/search` API endpoint used to find models. Write a test script (`test_api.py`) to query it.
*   **[ ] [2B] Data Integration:** Next step is to write a function that processes the JSON response from the API to extract model names, parameter counts, and sizes.
*   **[ ] [2C] Table Generation:** To be developed.
