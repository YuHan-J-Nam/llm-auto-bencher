# Project Progress Log

This document tracks the milestones and progress for the LLM Auto-Bencher project.

---

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Planning

*   **[✅] Project Directory:** Created the main `llm-auto-bencher` directory structure, including the `shell_equivalents` sub-folder.
*   **[✅] Version Control:** Initialized a Git repository and successfully linked it to a remote on GitHub.
*   **[✅] Planning Documents:** Created and populated the core project documents:
    *   `README.md`: High-level project overview.
    *   `PROJECT_PLAN.md`: Detailed scope, goals, and technical architecture.
    *   `ROADMAP.md`: Step-by-step milestone plan.
*   **[✅] Python Environment:** Set up a `venv` virtual environment and a `requirements.txt` file.

### Phase 2: Milestone 1 - Hardware Detection

#### Milestone 1A: Python Implementation
*   **Status:** ✅ **Completed**
*   **Description:** Developed a robust Python script (`main.py`) to automatically detect system hardware.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Detects CPU core count and total system RAM using the `psutil` library.
    *   Detects NVIDIA GPU model, VRAM, and driver version by programmatically calling the `nvidia-smi` command.
    *   **Detects root partition device name, total, used, and free disk space using `psutil`.**
    *   Implements robust `try...except` error handling to gracefully manage systems without NVIDIA GPUs or drivers.
    *   Consolidates all collected data into a single, structured dictionary for easy use.

#### Milestone 1B: Shell Script Equivalent
*   **Status:** ✅ **Completed**
*   **Description:** Developed a parallel shell script (`shell_equivalents/detect_hardware.sh`) for educational comparison.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Detects CPU cores and total RAM using `lscpu`, `free`, `grep`, and `awk`.
    *   Demonstrated floating-point math in Bash using `awk` for data conversion (MB to GB).
    *   Detects NVIDIA GPU details by parsing output from `nvidia-smi`.
    *   **Detects root partition disk details using `df`, `grep`, and `awk`.**
    *   Implemented robust error handling using `if command -v ...` to manage systems without a GPU.

### Phase 3: Milestone 2 - Running an LLM via Docker

*   **Status:** ⏳ **Up Next**
*   **Description:** The goal is to get a standard LLM running in a Docker container, exposing an API endpoint that we can communicate with for benchmarking.
